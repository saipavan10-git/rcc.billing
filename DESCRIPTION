Description: REDCap Automated Billing is an automated, data-driven service billing system for a REDCap system. The University of Floridaâ€™s CTS-IT designed and wrote this system to charge a modest annual fee for each project and bill for customer support work logged in a REDCap-based service request system. This generates revenue, reduces data privacy risks by incentivizing the deletion of abandoned projects, and improves the quality of research productivity metrics.
