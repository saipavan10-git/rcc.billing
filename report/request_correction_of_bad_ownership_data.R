<p>The REDCap project listed below has been identified as having out-of-date PI or owner information. Emails to PI/Owner listed on this project have been bouncing. We have erased those bad emails addresses, but a correct email address is needed to address billing issues. Please go into the Main Project Settings and update the PI/ownership information at <project_hyperlink>. </p>

<p>If this is not corrected within the next 30 days, the project will be sequestered and you will no longer have access to it. If the project is still sequestered one year from now, the project will be deleted at that time.</p>

<p>We are sending this email to everyone who has design rights on this REDCap project. Please confer with them if you are unsure who the Owner/PI is. Those people are:</p>

<users_with_design_rights>

<p>If you no longer need or use this REDCap project, we encourage you to export your project design and your project data, and delete the project. To delete a project, access its project link above then follow the instructions in <a href=\"https://www.ctsi.ufl.edu/wordpress/files/2023/07/How-to-Delete-a-Project-in-REDCap_new.pdf\">Deleting a Project in REDCap</a>.</p>
<p>Instructions on how to update the PI/Owner can be found at <a href=\"https://www.ctsi.ufl.edu/wordpress/files/2023/07/How-to-Update-Change-Project-Ownership-Info-PI-Name-and-IRB-Number.pdf\">Update Project Ownership, PI Name & Email and IRB Number in REDCap</a>.</p>
